1. So basically i have 2 ways of doing a thing!
  a. stroing the coordinated of the walls and merging it in the last!
  b. storing the coordinate of the gate and when wall got burn convert it into the gate!

2. Till now i am going thought the first approach, but i guess i should go with the second one!
3. I tried the 2nd one and its working perfectly but no w i have to add other things because of that i feel like 1st one is better logic.
